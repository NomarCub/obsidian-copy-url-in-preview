# Image Context Menus

This plugin provides the following context menus for images in [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md/):
- Copy to clipboard
- Open in default app
- Show in system explorer
- Reveal file in navigation
  - Reveal in [File Tree Alternative](https://github.com/ozntel/file-tree-alternative)
- Open in new tab
  - also available through middle mouse button click

Context menus are also added to the canvas.  
Most features work on mobile, but were only tested on Android.

> This plugin used to be called "Copy Image and URL context menu". It had link URL copying functionality (see [1.5.2](https://github.com/NomarCub/obsidian-copy-url-in-preview/tree/1.5.2) and prior), but that was removed when it was included in Obsidian 1.5.  
> It also used to have an `Open PDF externally` hover context menu for embedded PDFs, which was also removed when better Obsidian native functionality appeared (see [1.9.1](https://github.com/NomarCub/obsidian-copy-url-in-preview/tree/1.9.1)).
