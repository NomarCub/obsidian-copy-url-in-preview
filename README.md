# Image Context Menus

This plugin provides the following context menus for images in [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md/):
- Copy to clipboard
- Open in default app
- Show in system explorer
- Reveal file in navigation
  - Reveal in [File Tree Alternative](https://github.com/ozntel/file-tree-alternative)
- Open in new tab
  - also available through middle mouse button click
- Rename

For online image embeds, only the "Copy to clipboard" option is available.  
Context menus are also added to the canvas.  
Most features work on mobile, but were only tested on Android.

> This plugin used to be called "Copy Image and URL context menu". It had link URL copying functionality (see [1.5.2](https://github.com/NomarCub/obsidian-copy-url-in-preview/tree/1.5.2) and prior), but that was removed when it was included in Obsidian 1.5.  
> It also used to have an `Open PDF externally` hover context menu for embedded PDFs, which was also removed when better Obsidian native functionality appeared (see [1.9.1](https://github.com/NomarCub/obsidian-copy-url-in-preview/tree/1.9.1)).
